                    I picked the Alarm sound for the textbook to complete. After seeing the different types of alarms mentioned, I decided to try making
                    one that had a few different alarm frequencies rather than the standard one, which is a little flat in comparison. I used one oscillator here, 
                    which I set to a start of 800 Hz, and one gain node, which connects to the global gain node (I did not need to use the global gain node here,
                    so it just connects the new gain node to the context destination). For the alarm, I did not see a need for any synthesis, so I instead used
                    frequency modulation. To do this, I made a function that changes the oscillator frequency in intervals, going between 800, 700, and 600 Hz.
                    This allows for the multiple tones of the alarm to be heard, while keeping the characteristic of alarms that it is a beep and not a continuous sound.
